# JcingWorld
### A Project by Jcing _[WIP]_.
---
JcingWorld is my attempt to create a simple 3D Java Game using LWJGL.<br>
I started by working along a [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP "ThinMatrix's Java OpenGL Tutorial") of [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix) and finally started to use it to do my own Thing :)
I actually only really copied the font classes (I will change them too - _eventually_) and some shading and other techniques because i think i can't implement them better at the moment.

Its currently in an extremely early creation phase and not yet ready to be tested effictively.<br>
I am using Eclipse for project management and editing and my personal project settings are staged for my personal comfort, maybe i will remove them soon.<br>
If you find Errors, sloppy or even critical mistakes i would be happy if you [contact](jasin95@googlemail.com) me, or start a discussion.<br>
_Obviously improvement-tipps are also very welcome._

  - mining
  - fishing
  - woodcutting
  - hunting
  - smithing
  - _and many more_
- a powerful housing system including:
  - precise wall-positioning and building posisibilities
  - furniture crafting
- a advanced three dimensional cave system
- a performance efficient server which everybody can run on their own devices
