# JcingWorld
### A Project by Jcing.

JcingWorld is my attempt to create my first simlple 3D Java Game using the LWJGL.

Its currently in creation an really not ready to be played or even be tested.

I'm working along with the LWJGL YouTube tutorial by ThinMatrix.

my goal is to use all features of this tutorial and even multiplayer support in the future.

if you find critical mistakes or just are interested and maybe have improvement ideas I would apreciate if you sent me a mail :)
