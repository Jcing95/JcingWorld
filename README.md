# JcingWorld
### A Project by Jcing _[WIP]_.
---
JcingWorld is my attempt to create a yet simple (but hopefully eventually major) 3D Java game using LWJGL.<br>
I started by working along a [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP "ThinMatrix's Java OpenGL Tutorial") of [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/user/ThinMatrix) and finally started to use that code to do my own Thing :)<br>
Actually I only really copied the font classes (I will change them too - _eventually_) and have mostly been orienting myself at many different techniques as for example the terrain generation or overall shading.<br>
For project management and editing I am using the Eclipse IDE. My personal project settings are commited just comfort, maybe I will remove them soon.<br>
Side fact: I probably learned about 95 percent of my modest OpenGL knowledge from this project.

**JcingWorld** currently is in an *extremely* early creation phase and is not yet, and *wont be* ready to be tested effictively *for quite a while*. This means the engine itself is not finished by far.<br>
If you find sloppy mistakes or even critical errors I would appreciate if you [contact](jasin95@googlemail.com) me, or create a issue on this repository.<br>
_Obviously improvement-tipps are also very welcome._

#####My Goals are:
- simple and smooth ingame World Editing
- leveling and fighting including many skills as:
  - mining
  - fishing
  - woodcutting
  - hunting
  - smithing
  - _and many more_
- a powerful housing system including:
  - precise wall-positioning and building posisibilities
  - furniture crafting
- a advanced three dimensional cave system
- a performance efficient server which everybody can run on their own devices

#####Other Features:
- a not so realistic drawn impression because thats more immersive that photorealistic edgy graphics. 
- highly moddable graphics due to dynamic texture loading.
